## NcaaMarchMadness

Code that accompanies [IBM Developer deep learning tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/cc-artificial-neural-networks-neuroph-machine-learning/) where I describe the neural network software I wrote to predict winners of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, held every year in March.

The code uses the [Neuroph framework](http://neuroph.sourceforge.net/download.html), along with data you download from [NCAA.com]().
