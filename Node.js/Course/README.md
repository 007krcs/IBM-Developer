I'm working on a Node.js Learning Path for IBM Code. This directory is a work in progress that contains (for now) the scribblings of code that will become the source for the LP.

# Caveats

* As of today (26 May 2018) the code here is a __WIP__. So please, no PRs with bug fixes (or other optimizations). I'm well aware that the code is not quite _there_ yet.

* Some of the code is (and will always be) **purposely** bad (or poorly optimized) in order to illustrate concepts as part of the LP.

* Use this code at your own risk. It's a __WORK IN PROGRESS__ (I may have mentioned that).

# When will the LP be published?

* I'm shooting for completing this by end of July 2018, but not sure when it will go live on the developerWorks, er IBM Code, site.
