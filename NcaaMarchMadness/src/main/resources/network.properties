base.directory=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_VALUE

# You can either:
# Modify this file with your property overrides
# (that is, values that override the defaults in NetworkProperties.java - see examples below).
# Or
# Create a file like this one on disk somewhere and edit the various
# run scripts (like run-mlp-trainer.sh) and set the JAVA_OPTS property
# to define a system variable called network.properties.file to point to
# your properties file. Have fun!
